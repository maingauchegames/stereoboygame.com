      <h1 class="mt-5">STEREO BOY Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>This policy describes the kind of player data we (Main Gauche Games) collect via the Stereo Boy game client.
      </p>

      <p>First off, we don't require players to consent to data collection to play the game. Players are presented with
        an opt-in prompt at the very start of the game. It might even be how you arrived at this document. If you
        happened to opt-in, this document should help you understand what we're collecting and why.</p>

      <p>We collect data for the following reasons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>To capture information about crashes and other error conditions in the game, with the goal of identifying
          and fixing bugs.</li>
        <li>To estimate the number of people playing the game for a given time period.</li>
        <li>To understand how players proceed through the game, e.g., which and how many levels they play, how many
          optional items they collect, how long they play, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not collect information for marketing purposes, nor do we sell the information we collect.</p>

      <p>The vast majority of the data we collect is restricted to technical details that come purely from the game,
        such as frame rate, memory consumption, how many levels were played, etc. Moreover, we analyze the data almost
        entirely in aggregated form, i.e., as averages, distributions, and sums.</p>

      <p>We do not collect any information that is tied directly to the real-world identity of the player. The game
        client does not have access to details like your name, contact info, age, etc. However, some of the information
        that the game collects may be considered personally-identifying information by stricter privacy laws such as the
        EU's GDPR. This includes the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Randomized tracking codes that are generated when you install the game and then persisted between play
          sessions. This is effectively a cookie, and it's how we can tell how many unique players we have.</li>
        <li>Non-unique details about your computer, such as your operating system, model of laptop, and type of CPU. These are mainly used to provide context in crash reports.</li>
        <li>Your IP address. We're not actually interested in IP addresses, but since we use vendors to collect and
          store the data, we can't prevent IPs from being collected.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not directly receive data from the game client. Instead, the data that the game collects is sent from
        player devices to two vendor services, each of which have their own privacy and data handling policies that
        could interest you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Unity Analytics, a general game analytics service. <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">Read
            their privacy policy</a>, starting with the heading "I play a game that was built with or uses certain Unity
          software, what should I know?"</li>
        <li>Bugsnag (aka SmartBear), a crash/error tracking service. The most useful document for our players is their
          <a href="https://smartbear.com/legal/data-processing-addendum/">Data Processing Addendum</a>, although it is
          written as if addressed to their direct customers, i.e., us.
        </li>
      </ul>
